# Git \& GitHub Lab:

* Understand basic Git concepts.
* Create and manage local and remote repositories.
* Use essential Git commands.
* Collaborate using GitHub (pull, push, branch, merge).
* Handle conflicts and create pull requests.
* Prepare a project for continuous integration.

## Exercice 5

### Task (in teams of 2–3 students):

* Fork the template repository provided by the instructor (e.g. tp-ci-cd-template).
* Each member creates a branch to add a small feature (e.g., a section in README a  simple HTML page, or a function).
* Submit a Pull Request for each branch.
* Resolve conflicts if needed.
* Clone, push, and pull from multiple machines.

## Random Walk Project
* the project is an implimentation of the loop erased radom walk algorithm, used to generate loop-free paths from random walks
```
Random walk:  A → B → C → B → D
Loop erased:  A → B → D   (the loop B → C → B is erased)
```

### the project :
> is a program that randomly moves across a grid, but erases loops whenever they appear, ensuring the final path never crosses itself, just like in Wilson’s algorithm or maze generation.
